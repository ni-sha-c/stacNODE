# stacNODE: Statistically Accurate Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

Pytorch based repository for learning chaotic dynamical systems with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations and Fourier Neural Operator.

## Package Version

```
torch==2.1.1
torchdiffeq==0.2.3
```

## Baseline System: Lorenz `63

The minimal example is `test_lorenz.py` under the `test` folder.

## Code

To test it on other chaotic systems, `cd test` and run `test_all.py`.
